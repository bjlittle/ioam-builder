IOAM docextensions
==================

The ioam-builder docextensions branch provides extensions for Sphinx
to document Parameterized classes and generate autodocs for the
modules and submodules in each project.

This branch will be cloned into each of the IOAM projects as a submodule
in the doc/extensions directory.
